It was late at night. The moon shone dimly beyond the thick treetops and lit the forest floor with a soft glow. Tom clutched his torch as he inched forward into the darkness. He was supposed to be at the cabin an hour ago but yet here he was, in the dead of the night, trying to get there without screaming or getting scared by the woods. As trees loomed from above, each shadow casted seemed to meld together and form shapes that scared him. It was all because of a stupid dare. And his stupid ego. He hunched over, trying his best not to get intimidated. As he walked, he though about what had happened before... 
"Hey, Tom! I bet you my new playstation that you don't dare to walk in the woods at mindnight and retrieve the skull for me!" Tom's friend, John, said. The woods were said to be possessed at midnight and everything would come alive, trying to protect the skull of the woods. The skull was basically the bones of the last villager that dared to enter the woods at midnight, and when the other villagers ventured into the woods the next day, all they found was his skull.
