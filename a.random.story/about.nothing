"Oh no," I gasped. I stared in horror at the mess on my table. As I hurriedly rushed to clean the mess up, I  heard gales of laughter behind my back and as I turned around, I only could see the silhouette of three dancing figures in the morning sun. Even without details, they seemed almost ghostly and their legs floated off the ground as if magnets repelling each other. I frowned. It was the third time this week that I had seen them. I turned to my friend, Xiao Ming, and said, "There they are, don't you see them?" He glanced and squinted but still shook his head. "Maybe you should check in with a psychiatrist." He never seemed to be able to see them no matter how bright the light was. 
"Argh! It been the third time this week! Even if they were bullies. Don't you think thats a little overboard?"
